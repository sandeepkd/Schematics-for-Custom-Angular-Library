# Schematics for Custom Angular Library

This is a schematics code base for angular library.

Please follow the below steps to implement this codebase in your angular library.

-- Create angular library work space <code>ng new custom-lib --create-application=false</code>

-- Go into custom-lib directory then generate your angular library <code>ng generate library common-lib</code>

-- Go into the library custom-lib > projects > common-lib > paste the schematics folder and tsconfig.schematics.json file.

-- Then follow the build process in my blog <a href="https://www.dinecodes.com/how-to-create-common-style-angular-library-and-use-it-in-component/" title="How to create Angular Library">How to create Angular Library</a>. Please give a star if you got help from it. Thanks
